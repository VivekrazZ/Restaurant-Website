# Restaurant-Website

A project based on creating a restaurant website is an easy project for developers to practice their learning, while helping them better their understanding about full-stack development. You will find a restaurant's website to be very interesting and interactive, necessitating you to focus on the front-end while making it user-friendly. This will also give you an introduction to UI design as a separate field.

The interface you build in this project should allow customers to select from various options, including food, themes, duration, quick delivery, seating, bookings, etc. It would help if you employed a variety of HTML, React, and CSS tools, such as radio buttons, checkboxes, action buttons, etc., to construct a restaurant website.
